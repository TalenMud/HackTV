# HackTV

We are making a platform for hack clubbers to show off the time and effort they are using to make their projects via livestreams!

HackTV uses essentially a Flask API to run, and what's different about this streaming platform, is that all the content displayed, from livestreams to ads are Hack Club related ! Showcase YSWS projects or amazing work, HackTV is the place where Hackers meet and chill all together !
